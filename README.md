# Fun With Books

In this project, I plan to create a simple, visually appealing, and interesting quarto dashboard using a Kaggle Dataset that stores data about a wide set of books, pulled from the now depriciated Goodreads API. All credit of data collection and cleaning to the original poster of the Kaggle dataset. 

## Data Access

The data can be found here: [Kaggle Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jealousleopard/goodreadsbooks/data).

You can also download the data with the following API command:

```         
kaggle datasets download -d jealousleopard/goodreadsbooks
```
